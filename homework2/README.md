## Inspirational Graph ##

I have decided to emulate the graphs given at https://www.inverse.com/article/18272-4-pokemon-go-graphs-that-show-just-how-big-the-game-is. This link was given in the critiques.pdf in the 02-classwork.zip foder.

### The Epochal Phonomenon of Pokeman Go ###
Pokeman Go is all over the news for all the right reasons. For the first time in the history, a digital game has been designed to let down the couch potatoes out there. In order to play, they ought to go out and run around to catch them all ! Nevertheless, those lazy game enthusiasts seem to be metamorphosed into fitness freaks- thanks to the game that took the world by strom within a week of its launch. People are leaving their comfort of their couch to venture out on to the open to chase the rare Pokemon species!

In the past one week, all the social media feeds,from my friends, pages I subscribe to, and news, were about the legendary phenomenon of Pokemon Go. I am neither an app nor a gaming enthusiast. It's not surprising that someone naturally becomes curious when the entire world begins to talk about something unprecedented.So I set out to grab dataset from all the available sources, such as Google trends, Github. In addition to emulating the graphs from a link given in the critique.pdf, I have tried to discover the fluctuations in interest rate for your favourite apps: Whatsapp, Facebook, Tinder, and now Pokemon Go. Google trends has provided me with rich data sets of download trends from different countries: US, UK, France, Spain, Brazil, Japan etc. Pokemon Go is phenomenal, but public interest in Whatsapp hasn't been faded down yet ! Towards the end of the first week of its launch, you would see Pokemon Go's download is dwindling in several countries.

I picked up a total of five search terms I thought would be interesting to discover the search trend over the past one year: trump, clinton, Islamic State, Game of Thrones, and Pokemon Go. The graph shows that clinton isn't a favourite search term as compared to the rest in the list. Search for Islamic State is at its peak when a mishap occurs in any of the corner of the world. Whereas, number of hit for Pokomon Go is all time high after it's launch and is uncomparable as far as other search terms are concerned.

## NASA Data Set ##
I picked up the NASA Laboratory facilities data set from  Data.gov: http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/agency-data-on-user-facilities. 
This time, in addition to reworking on the graphs that I had created earlier, more graphs have been added to visually represent the distribution and growth trend of NASA Laboratory facilities in the USA.
